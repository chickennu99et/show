  In the 1890s, decades before the Oreo was invented when Jacob and Joseph opened a
bakery together in Kansas City, Missouri, in the 1890s. Then Jacob made the American Biscuit
and Manufacturing Company and he became the president. Then Jacob got sick and assigned
joseph as the president. After a long time, he found a new partner and made the oreo. However,

  In the 1950s Oreo rebranded itself and raised its price point, and it was extremely
successful. Today, the Hydrox is little-known and the Oreo is the world's most popular cookie.
When hydrox made its comeback in 2015, leaf brands attempted to sue oreo. However, oreo
used a different filling. Then, hydrox posted on Facebook explaining how oreo purposefully hid
their products. Mondelez is using its direct store distribution employees to hide Hydrox cookies
in stores. Leaf brands say that they did this to lower their sales volume. The FTC is currently
investigating this but they haven't said anything yet.
